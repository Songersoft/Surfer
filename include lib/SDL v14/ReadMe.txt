CREDITS!!

This UDF was written by AdmiralAlkex.

Lots of help was received from monoceres (see notes in source).
ProgAndy, Valik & wus also helpep some (see notes in source).

Images and Examples created by AdmiralAlkex.
Except Opera_AutoIt.png that was shamelessly stolen from thread 59517 in the AutoIt forums.
SDL_gfx.dll was compiled by monoceres.



FUTURE DEVELOPMENT!!

I have not finished all functions, and those that are left are quite tricky so don't count on me fixing them today.
If you want to help then feel free to write a few of the missing/broken functions and then post them on the forum or send them to me and I will update the UDF with them.



DOCUMENTATION!!

I have not written any documentation so you will have to make due with what's available for other languages.

Remember these two rules and it should be easier for you:
A. Functions generally look like this: _SDL_SomeFunc(), except in some external libraries (e.g. _SPG_SomeFunc() for the sprig lib).
B. Functions return 1 on success not 0 (changed from default behaviour to look more like AutoIt)

The best documentation I have seen so far are the SDLRef.chm (included in package) and online @ http://sdl.beuc.net/sdl.wiki/FrontPage

Documentation for multiple languages and formats can be downloaded from SDL's official website @ http://www.libsdl.org/docs.php



SUPPORT!!

If you need any help then please use the forum so others can read our posts and benefit too.
If you want to talk to me personally then please see my profile in the AutoIt forums.
